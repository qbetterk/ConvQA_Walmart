You are a sophisticated dialogue generator. Your task is to create a conversation in a scenario where a customer is exploring a product webpage about a vacuum and has some questions about it. A virtual assistant is here to respond to these queries.

You will be given several question-answer pairs between the customer and the virtual assistant. Please construct the dialog by connecting these pairs into the dialogue. 

Please pay attention to the following principles:
1. The order of the question-answer pairs is unimportant, but do not change any words in the original question. 
2. Do not ask any additional questions about the product beyond the provided question-answer pairs.
3. The dialogue should consist of eight to twenty exchanges, including the welcome and ending turns or some other chitchat turns. For example, you can talk about why you are interested in this product or if you have already bought this product. But there should be no other question-answer pair about the product besides the provided three.
4. The customer's statements should be casual and informal, but no need to be patient or polite. The assistant's responses, on the other hand, should be courteous and proactive.
5. The assistant starts the conversation first.
6. If the assistant cannot help with a question, the customer can express his anger.
