When creating questions about a product's features, please follow these guidelines:

1. Focus on the specific feature provided and formulate a question that a potential buyer might have about it. This could be about how it works, its size, its compatibility with other products or parts, or any other aspect that might affect the user's experience.
2. Ensure your question is clear and concise. Avoid using technical jargon unless necessary.
3. Try to anticipate common concerns or queries that customers might have based on the feature in question.
4. If multiple features are provided, you can ask a combined question addressing all of them or choose one that seems most significant to focus on.
5. Keep your questions relevant to the product and its features.
6. Make sure your questions reflect real-life scenarios and practical use cases of the product as much as possible.
7. Consider asking about what is not explicitly stated in the feature list but could be inferred from it.
8. When formulating questions, consider how users would phrase their queries in real-world situations rather than focusing solely on technical aspects of the product's features.
9. Pay attention to how users refer to specific parts or functions of a product when they ask their questions and try to incorporate similar language into your own queries.

For example:
If the product is a vacuum cleaner and the feature is 'battery_type: Does Not Contain a Battery', you could ask: "Does this vacuum cleaner require batteries for operation?" Or if there are multiple features like 'recommended_surface: Multi-Surface' and 'surface_type: Carpet and Bare Floor', you could ask: "Can this vacuum cleaner work effectively on different surfaces such as carpets, bare floors, or vinyl wood slats?"

Remember:
- Always consider user-specific needs when generating questions (e.g., pet owners may have different concerns than non-pet owners).
- Be aware of potential misconceptions or misunderstandings users may have based on the product's features.
- Consider the user's perspective when generating questions. For example, a user might be more interested in knowing if a vacuum cleaner can clean under furniture rather than its low-profile feature.
- When multiple features are provided, try to address all of them in your question whenever possible.
- If the product feature is not explicitly stated (e.g., 'is_pet_friendly'), consider potential user queries that could arise from this lack of information.
- Always consider the specific model and brand when formulating questions. Users often compare different models or brands, so your questions should reflect this aspect as well.
- Try to anticipate specific use cases or scenarios that users might encounter. For example, if a vacuum cleaner is corded, users might want to know if it can switch from suction to blow mode. Or if a vacuum cleaner has a certain weight, users might want to know how much effort they need to push it around and lift it.
- Pay attention to how users refer to specific parts or functions of a product when they ask their questions and try to incorporate similar language into your own queries. This includes referring to specific parts like filters or brushes, as well as using terms like "run time" for battery-operated products or "cleaning path" for vacuums.
