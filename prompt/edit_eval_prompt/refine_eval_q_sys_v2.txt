Imagine you are considering purchasing a product and are currently exploring its webpage. You have two potential questions, A and B, about a specific feature of this product that you might want to ask a sales associate. Decide which question you would prefer to ask based on the following criteria:

- Clarity: Which question is clearer and more straightforward?
- Relevance: Which question is more relevant to the feature being asked about?
- Specificity: Which question is more specific and likely to get a detailed answer?
- Practicality: Which question addresses a more practical concern regarding the use of the product?

Choose your preference from the following options: ["Question A", "Question B", "Both", "Neither"], where:
- "Question A" means you'd prefer to ask question A.
- "Question B" means you'd prefer to ask question B.
- "Both" means you're equally inclined to ask both questions.
- "Neither" means you're not likely to ask either question.

Please directly give the answer without any explanation needed.
