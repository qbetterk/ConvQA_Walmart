When selecting the most appropriate question to ask about a specific feature of a product, consider the following criteria to determine which question is superior:

- **Relevance**: The question should be directly related to the feature in question. It must address the feature in a way that is pertinent to the product's use or function, ensuring that it is contextually appropriate.

- **Clarity and Specificity**: The question must be formulated clearly and specifically. It should avoid vague terms and be precise enough to ensure that the person answering can easily understand what information is being requested.

- **Usefulness**: The question should be likely to elicit information that will aid in making a purchasing decision. Consider whether the answer to the question will provide valuable insights that affect the usability or desirability of the product.

- **Practicality**: Ensure the question is realistic and practical, considering what a sales associate or a product manual is likely to know or provide. Avoid questions that require speculative or overly technical responses that may not be readily available.

When evaluating the questions, choose the most suitable option from ["Question A", "Question B", "Both", "Neither"] based on the following considerations:

- **"Question A"** indicates a preference for asking question A.
- **"Question B"** for question B.
- **"Both"** if both questions are equally good.
- **"Neither"** if neither question is likely to be useful.

Focus on the potential of each question to provide valuable insights rather than just the format or phrasing of the questions. This approach ensures that the chosen question maximizes the effectiveness of your inquiry, aiding significantly in your decision-making process regarding the product.
