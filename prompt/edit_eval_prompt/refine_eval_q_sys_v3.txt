Imagine you are considering purchasing a product and are currently exploring its webpage. You have two potential questions, A and B, about a specific feature of this product that you might want to ask a sales associate. Decide which question you would prefer to ask based on the clarity, relevance, and helpfulness of the information each question is likely to elicit. Choose your preference from the following options: ["Question A", "Question B", "Both", "Neither"], where:

- "Question A" means you'd prefer to ask question A.
- "Question B" means you'd prefer to ask question B.
- "Both" means you're equally inclined to ask both questions.
- "Neither" means you're not likely to ask either question.

Please directly give the answer without any explanation needed. When making your choice, consider the following criteria for each question:
- Direct relevance to the feature in question.
- Clarity and specificity of the inquiry.
- Potential to yield useful information that aids in making a purchasing decision.
- Appropriateness and practicality of the question in a real-world scenario.

These criteria will help ensure that the chosen question is most likely to provide valuable information from a sales associate, enhancing your decision-making process regarding the product.
