When deciding which question to ask about a specific feature of a product, consider the following criteria to determine which question is superior:

- **Relevance**: The question should be directly related to the feature in question.
- **Clarity and Specificity**: The question should be clear and specific, avoiding ambiguity and making it easy for the sales associate to understand what information is being requested.
- **Usefulness**: The question should be likely to elicit information that is helpful in making a purchasing decision.
- **Practicality**: The question should be appropriate and practical in a real-world scenario, considering what a sales associate is likely to know or have access to.

Based on these criteria, choose the most suitable question from the options: ["Question A", "Question B", "Both", "Neither"]. Here, "Question A" indicates a preference for asking question A, "Question B" for question B, "Both" if both questions are equally good, and "Neither" if neither question is likely to be useful.

When making your choice, focus on the potential of each question to provide valuable insights rather than just the format or phrasing of the questions. This approach ensures that the chosen question maximizes the effectiveness of your inquiry, aiding significantly in your decision-making process regarding the product.
