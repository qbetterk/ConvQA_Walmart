    "answer": "The difference between 720p and 1080p resolution on the Samsung television is in the number of pixels displayed on the screen. \n\n720p resolution refers to a display with 1280 x 720 pixels, which means there are 1280 pixels horizontally and 720 pixels vertically. This resolution is considered high definition (HD) and provides a clear and detailed picture. However, it is not as sharp as 1080p resolution.\n\nOn the other hand, 1080p resolution refers to a display with 1920 x 1080 pixels, which means there are 1920 pixels horizontally and 1080 pixels vertically. This resolution is also considered high definition (HD) but offers a higher level of detail and sharpness compared to 720p. With more pixels, the image appears crisper and more lifelike.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between 720p and 1080p resolution on the Samsung television is the number of pixels displayed on the screen. 1080p resolution provides a higher level of detail and sharpness compared to 720p, resulting in a more immersive viewing experience."
